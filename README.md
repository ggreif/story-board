This is story-board, a Haskell replacement for Keynode, Powerpoint or
beamer, in the spirit of Racket's slideshow. The key idea is using
JavaScript HTML5 Canvas to render all the text and images. Diagrams
can be drawn using Haskell's diagrams package, The Active Applicative
Functor can be used to key animation, and there is good support for
laying out both narritive, and highlighted code. There is support for
building stand-alone JavaScript, as well as movies of slides.

```haskell
main = print "Hello"
```
